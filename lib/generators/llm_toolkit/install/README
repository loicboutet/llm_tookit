LlmToolkit has been installed. Next steps:

1. Run the migrations:
   $ bin/rails llm_toolkit:install:migrations
   $ bin/rails db:migrate

2. Review the generated initializer at config/initializers/llm_toolkit.rb
   and customize it for your application's needs.

3. Include the Conversable concern in any models that should support conversations:
   
   class Project < ApplicationRecord
     include LlmToolkit::Conversable
     
     def generate_system_messages(role = :coder)
       # Define custom system messages here
     end
   end

4. Create custom tools if needed in app/services/llm_toolkit/tools/
